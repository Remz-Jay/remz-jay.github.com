    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Just a quick post with the oneliner of the day.</em></p>

<p>When you are debugging catalog compilation issues or other puppet performance issues in general, it is good to know exactly which catalogs are slow to compile. Knowing which catalogs are substantially slower than others allows you to focus on those catalogs and the modules they contain.</p>

<p>I devised this bash oneliner, <a href="http://www.unixcl.com/2008/09/group-by-clause-functionality-in-awk.html">which is almost a direct copy of this example by Jadu Saikia</a>, so full credits go to him!</p>

<pre><code class="bash Calculating Average Catalog Compilation Times in Puppet">cat /var/log/puppet/master.log | grep -i "compiled catalog for" | awk '{printf "%s\t%s\r\n",$9,$14}' | sort | awk 'BEGIN{FS="\t"; printf("%-35s\t\t%s\t\t%s\t\t%s\n", "Node","Count","Total","Average")} NR!=1 {a[$1]++;b[$1]=b[$1]+$2}END{for (i in a) printf("%-35s\t%10.0f\t%10.0f\t%10.2f\n", i, a[i], b[i], b[i]/a[i])}' | sort -n -k4
</code></pre>

<p>This will yield a result similar to:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Just a quick post with the oneliner of the day.</em></p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: after a bacula director restart a couple of jobs were stuck on the FD with message:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Bacula File Director Error">Running Jobs:
Writing: Incremental Backup job node.cluster.company.com JobId=8702 Volume=""
    pool="bacula.director.company.com:pool:default.incremental" device="DefaultFileStorage" (/mnt/bacula/default)
    spooling=0 despooling=0 despool_wait=0
    Files=0 Bytes=0 AveBytes/sec=0 LastBytes/sec=0
FDSocket closed
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>There were a couple of these jobs that were stuck, preventing all other jobs from running, because those were waiting for a free slot on the FD.</p>

<p><strong>Solution?</strong> Well, I <em>could</em> have resumed or fixed those jobs, but I&rsquo;m in a hurry, so I just cancelled them so the rest of the schedule could be processed. And I&rsquo;m lazy too, so I just cancelled all currently writing jobs in one go:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Bacula Oneliner: Cancel all currently writing jobs">for j in `echo "s storage" | bconsole | grep -i writing | awk '{print $6}'`; do echo "cancel $j" | bconsole; done
</code></pre>

<p>After that, the schedule started processing right away. Next issue.</p>

    <link href="https://rem.co/blog/2015/01/15/bacula-purging-and-deleting-old-volumes/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-15T14:08:02+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://rem.co/blog/2015/01/15/bacula-purging-and-deleting-old-volumes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using bacula for a couple of months now in conjunction with puppet to
make automated backups of all servers that are managed by puppet.
My bacula setup labels a volume for every job it runs with a unique name:</p>

<pre><code class="ini Bacula Label Format">Label Format = "${Job}.${Year}${Month:p/2/0/r}${Day:p/2/0/r}.${Hour:p/2/0/r}${Minute:p/2/0/r}"
</code></pre>

<p>These volumes are automatically purged once the retention of all files contained on the volume expires (which is
        configured per-pool). Due to the unique names however, the volumes cannot
be recycled. The result of this is that the volumes that have been marked as
purged in the catalog remain as-is on the disk. After some time this ultimately
resulted in a full disk, thus halting all backups performed on that pool. Not
good. Not good at all.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I thought volumes would be truncated at the time they are marked as purged, but
I probably made some configuration error somewhere along the road or I don&rsquo;t
quite understand how the truncating process works, because all of my purged
disks are using their original disk space.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m pressed for time and can&rsquo;t be bothered with old backups anyway,
                I&rsquo;ve decided to just delete all purged volumes (which were beyond their
                        retention date anyway). Perhaps the steps I took to delete these
                volumes can help others (Or others can recommend me a better way to
                        deal with old volumes), so here goes:</p>

<h2>Pruning all clients</h2>

<p>Before you start cleaning old volumes, it might be wise to ensure that all
volumes are pruned before cleaning, so you maximize the number of volumes you
are going to delete.</p>

<pre><code class="bash Pruning all clients">#!/bin/bash
clients=`mysql -e'select Name from Client ORDER BY Name ASC;' bacula | tail -n+2`

for client in `echo $clients`
do
  echo "prune files client=${client} yes" | bconsole
done
</code></pre>

<h2>Checking the number of volumes to be purged</h2>

<p>Using <code>list volumes</code> in <code>bconsole</code> you can check the status of all volumes known to bacula.
I&rsquo;m merely interested in the number of volumes that are currently marked as purged:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Listing the number of Purged Volumes">echo "list volumes" | bconsole | grep "Purged" | awk {'print $4'} | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>This resulted in a list of <em>thousands</em> of volumes. (We&rsquo;re running, full, incremental and diff backups, so the numbers stack up). Time to get rid of them.</p>

<h2>Removing purged volumes from the catalog and deleting them</h2>

<p>Using this script I&rsquo;ve removed all purged volumes from the catalog, after which they were physically deleted from the disk, freeing up precious space for more recent backups.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Deleting all Purged Volumes</p></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    rm -rf /mnt/bacula/default/<span class="nv">$f</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<h2>Removing volumes that are missing from the catalog</h2>

<p>Somehow I also ended up with some volumes on the disk that were not present in the bacula catalog at all. In my opinion these could be cleaned up as well, hence:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Deleting volumes that are not present in the catalog">#!/bin/bash

cd /mnt/bacula/default
for i in `find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf "%f\n"`; do
  echo "list volume=$i" | bconsole | if grep --quiet "No results to list"; then
        echo "$i is ready to be deleted"
        rm -f /mnt/bacula/default/$i
  fi
done
</code></pre>

<h2>Finishing up</h2>

<p>To prevent full disks these tasks should be scheduled using <code>cron</code> and run daily (or at least weekly) to keep your disks and catalog lean &amp; clean.</p>

    <updated>2014-11-28T13:36:57+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://rem.co/blog/2014/11/28/gentoo-running-a-minecraft-1-dot-8-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Running a dedicated Minecraft server can be a challenging job. You have to find a balance between performance and usability using &ldquo;server software&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be designed to provide for long running, resilient services.</p>

<p>Being a first-time Minecraft server operator I had to tackle various challenges in order to come up with a way to provide a stable and reliable service to my players. The following article is a recollection of the things I implemented and scripts I wrote in order to run a Minecraft 1.8 server. The scripts mentioned are specific to Gentoo Linux, but could also be used on most other Linux flavours, albeit with some modifications to match that platform&rsquo;s <code>init.d</code> scripts.</p>

<!-- more --> 


<h2>Preparations</h2>

<h3>Screen</h3>

<p>In the scripts we&rsquo;re going to use we use <code>screen</code> as the means to deamonize the Minecraft process. I&rsquo;ve given this a lot of thought, because using <code>screen</code> as a deamonizer feels very wrong  to me when there are dedicated tools (such as the <code>start-stop-daemon</code>) for that particular job. Furthermore, I&rsquo;m more of a <code>tmux</code> guy myself when it comes to terminal multiplexing.</p>

<p>However, after searching the internet, <code>screen</code> seems to be the most popular way of daemonizing Minecraft by far. I don&rsquo;t dare to speculate on wether this is caused by a lack of knowledge in the Minecraft server scene or based on a sound choice.</p>

<p>I have my own reasons for using <code>screen</code> instead of <code>start-stop-deamon</code> or <code>tmux</code>:
-  <code>screen</code> (and/or <code>tmux</code>) allows me to interact with the game&rsquo;s console. If I use <code>start-stop-daemon</code> instead, the process will be truly deamonized, and there is no way to bring it to the foreground anymore to allow for interaction. Why do we <em>need</em> console interaction you might ask? Because we do backups for example. In order to have reliable backups, we have to tell the Minecraft server to flush any changes to the disk and stop saving while the backup is running. This is all done using console commands.
- <code>screen</code> has an awesome command, <code>stuff</code>, that allows us to send commands to a detached (deamonized)  instance. This provides us with the possibility of interacting with a running instance using scripts/services <em>outside</em> of that screen instance.</p>

<p>So, before we continue, make sure <code>screen</code> is installed on your box:</p>

<pre><code># emerge -av app-misc/screen
</code></pre>

<h3>Java SE 8</h3>

<p>My first attempts on running Minecraft 1.8 used the JDK that was present on my box at that time, being <code>IcedTea JDK 6.1.13.3 [icedtea-bin-6]</code>. You <em>can</em> actually use that JDK (or any other Java SE 6 JDK/JRE for that matter), but my installation was haunted by substantial, noticeable lag while the server process was using 100% CPU non-stop (on one core, the  main Minecraft server process being single-threaded) and the console and logs were spammed with these warnings:</p>

<pre><code>[23:52:10] [Server thread/WARN]: Can't keep up! Did the system time change, or is the server overloaded? Running 19381ms behind, skipping 387 tick(s)
</code></pre>

<p>Despite all optimisations that you will read about in this article that were already in effect at that time, the lag remained, and would at times get so bad that Minecraft&rsquo;s  internal watchdog would mark the server as crashed:</p>

<pre><code>[21:21:15] [Server Watchdog/FATAL]: A single server tick took 60.00 seconds (should be max 0.05)
[21:21:15] [Server Watchdog/FATAL]: Considering it to be crashed, server will forcibly shutdown.
[21:21:15] [Server Watchdog/ERROR]: This crash report has been saved to: /mnt/ramdisk/./crash-reports/crash-2014-11-27_21.21.15-server.txt
[21:21:15] [Server Shutdown Thread/INFO]: Stopping server
</code></pre>

<p>After some research on the internet some posts mentioned that upgrading to Java 8 could make all the difference, so I did. And it worked! While CPU usage is still reasonably high (around 70~80% at most times), the lag and warnings are gone, and subsequently, so are the crashes. So, I&rsquo;ll advise to use the same JDK as I did in this article. To install:</p>

<pre><code># emerge -av dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Read</strong> the error you receive from running that command, resolve the fetch restriction by following the instructions in that error message and continue installing. Afterwards:</p>

<pre><code># java-config --list-available-vms
The following VMs are available for generation-2:
1)      IcedTea JDK 6.1.13.3 [icedtea-bin-6]
*)      Oracle JDK 1.8.0.25 [oracle-jdk-bin-1.8] 

# java-config --set-system-vm 2
Now using oracle-jdk-bin-1.8 as your generation-2 system JVM
</code></pre>

<p>The command above marks the newly installed JDK as your system JVM. This might not be a possibility for you if you have other software on your system that is incompatible with Java 8 (or the Oracle JDK). In that case, you can set the installed JDK as the User VM for the user you are using to run Minecraft. To do so:</p>

<pre><code># su &lt;minecraftuser&gt;
$ java-config --set-user-vm 2
Now using oracle-jdk-bin-1.8 as your user JVM
</code></pre>

<h3>RAMDisk</h3>

<p>Being haunted by performance issues, I&rsquo;ve read quite a lot on Minecraft server performance and optimisation. There is one article that stands out from the crowd and is a <em>must</em> read for everyone running Minecraft servers. I encourage you to go and read <a href="http://www.sk89q.com/2013/03/improving-your-minecraft-servers-performance/">sk89q&rsquo;s Improving your Minecraft server’s performance</a> first before continuing this article.</p>

<p>Among other minor optimisations, such as the Java flags that are used in my setup, one of the biggest influences is the use of a RAMDisk to host your Minecraft setup on. This eliminates any delays caused by <code>iowait</code> due to slow disks and speeds up various tasks, such as loading the map. I use a Dell PowerEdge 1950 III Blade server as the hardware platform for my Minecraft server, and although beefy as it may be for this purpose, it is not equipped with SSD&rsquo;s which is a potential cause for performance degradation. The installation/use of a RAMDisk is quite easy, but there are some drawbacks you have to keep in mind, such as that RAMDisks are not permanent storage. In case you suffer a power outage or kernel panic, the data on your RAMDisk is gone. To counter this issue, you&rsquo;ll have to implement some way to synchronise the RAMDisk from/to persistant storage.</p>

<p>The <code>init.d</code> script we&rsquo;ll later discuss takes care of all this hassle, but in order for it to work, we first have to create the RAMDisk.</p>

<p>Edit your <code>/etc/fstab</code> and add a RAMDisk at a mountpoint of your choise:</p>

<pre><code># vim /etc/fstab
tmpfs                   /mnt/ramdisk    tmpfs           rw,nodev,nosuid,size=2G,uid=1000,gid=1000,mode=1700     0 0
</code></pre>

<p>Adjust the <code>size=</code> parameter to match the amount of spare (unused) RAM you have available and the size of your actual Minecraft installation. (My installation is only 300MB actually, but I have 36GB RAM in this machine which is mostly vacant so I picked a comfortably large disk size). Adjust the <code>uid=</code> and <code>gid=</code> parameters to the id&rsquo;s of the dedicated user you are using to run your Minecraft server with. (Never run trivial services such as this as <code>root</code>!).</p>

<p>Next, create the mountpoint:</p>

<pre><code># mkdir /mnt/ramdisk
</code></pre>

<p>And try to mount the RAMDisk and see if it works:</p>

<pre><code># mount /mnt/ramdisk
# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda3        63G   48G   13G  80% /
udev             10M  4.0K   10M   1% /dev
tmpfs           7.9G  628K  7.9G   1% /run
shm             7.9G     0  7.9G   0% /dev/shm
cgroup_root      10M     0   10M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs           7.9G   72K  7.9G   1% /tmp
/dev/sdb1       200G  192G  8.2G  96% /mnt/backups
tmpfs           2.0G  297M  1.8G  15% /mnt/ramdisk 
</code></pre>

<h3>Install Minecraft as you normally would</h3>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, install a Minecraft like you normally would. For me, that is a directory <code>/home/remco/minecraft</code>  which contains the server <code>.jar</code>, the world and all settings.</p>

<h2>The Scripts</h2>

<p>The <code>init.d</code> script is what makes this setup tick. It does all the heavy lifting. The location for this script is <code>/etc/init.d/minecraft</code>
